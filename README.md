# EfficientNet-Keras

This repository contains an op-for-op Keras reimplementation of EfficientNet, the new convolutional neural network architecture from [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) ([TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet)). 

This repository is being built at this very momement. When finished, it will include: 
 * Loading pre-trained EfficientNet models
 * Evaluating the models on ImageNet
 * Predicting on your own images with the models
 * Training new EfficientNet models

Check back very soon for the models! 

### About EfficientNet Models

If you're new to EfficientNets, here is an explanation straight from the official TensorFlow implementation: 

EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster than previous models. We develop EfficientNets based on AutoML and Compound Scaling. In particular, we first use [AutoML Mobile framework](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/mnasnet-towards-automating-design-of.html) to develop a mobile-size baseline network, named as EfficientNet-B0; Then, we use the compound scaling method to scale up this baseline to obtain EfficientNet-B1 to B7.

EfficientNets achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet with an order of magnitude better efficiency:


* In high-accuracy regime, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet with 66M parameters and 37B FLOPS, being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on CPU inference than previous best [Gpipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06965).

* In middle-accuracy regime, our EfficientNet-B1 is 7.6x smaller and 5.7x faster on CPU inference than [ResNet-152](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), with similar ImageNet accuracy.

* Compared with the widely used [ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), our EfficientNet-B4 improves the top-1 accuracy from 76.3% of ResNet-50 to 82.6% (+6.3%), under similar FLOPS constraint.
